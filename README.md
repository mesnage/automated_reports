Procedure to automate the production of personal reports

These scripts can be used to make a loop and create personal reports using pagedown in R.

I created this system to generate a series of report for the Buchinger Wilhelmi clinic. They were meant to thank patients for their participation to the “Detox study" which published in the journal <i>Antioxidants</i>. This study revealed that the oxidative stress decreased during a 10±3 day fasting that patients spent at the Buchinger Wilhelmi Clinic in the period from September until December 2019, and that the antioxidant machinery was stimulated.
